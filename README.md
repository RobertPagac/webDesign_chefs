# Cook&Meet
### Specification(In progress)

#### Purpose of the application:
The purpose of the applications is to strengthen the relationships between students living in the dormitories by spending time together cooking and sharing their meals.


####  The stakeholder (customer): Describe shortly the stakeholder/customer – the owner/operator of the web site/application. What are their goals, what is their mission?


####  Goals:
The main goal of this application is to connect the students living in the dormitories by spending their time together while cooking. Any user can become a "main chef" and create a cooking event for others to join. The application will enable the "main chef" to set up an event visible to other users by entering the meal they want to cook and the time frame they are available. The "main chef" should also add a predicted budget of that exact meal per portion, they can discuss details in the chat to set up the way they will split the cost - can either pay by cash during the event or by transfer. Other users will see events listed by the "main chefs," and can easily join any event they want. After such confirmation they will be automatically added to the event chat. To make the decision whether to join the event or not even easier, all users can leave rating to the recipe and all participants of that event(star rating and optional text feedback). Each user that has ever created any event will have a history of his recipes on their profile, that will not only help them to make the process of event creation faster, but also can see the feedback of others on his cooking skills. 

####  Success measures: How can you quantitatively measure whether your site/app is successful? What values of these measure do you want to achieve?
We can measure it by the star ratings of the users among each other, by the amount of events created and successfuly carried out. We want to have the average star rating close to 5 and the amount of successful events as high as possible.

####  Competition analysis: The idea that you come up with has probably already been explored and implemented by someone else. Are there any similar web sites/applications? What can you learn from them? What are the things you like/dislike about their approach? What are the users' expectations with this kind of sites/applications (your best guess)? You can analyze competing solutions one by one, but always concisely summarize the important findings of the whole competition analysis. 
We are not aware of any similar-looking websites or applications, as the main goal of this website is really specific.

Detailed specification and functional requirements will be available in the documents folder.

####  Functional requirements: What functionality will be required to achieve the application's goals?
  - Set up user profile
  - create the cooking event for others to join - place there an offer of an exact meal they want to cookvand the time frame they are available
  - add a predicted budget of that exact meal per portion
  - join the cooking event somebody else created
  - preview user that created a cooking event, his history what he already cooked or joined
  - Provide recipe rating and rate the main chef and participating chefs (star rating and optional text feedback)
  - filtering the events based on dormitories, time, cuisine,... and searching for a specific event

 #### User Types:
 - Admin
 - Normal User

####  Non-functional requirements: What other requirements do you have? These are often high-level requirements on how the app should behave, interact, perform its functions, be implemented or deployed in terms of performance, security, availability, software quality, documentation, maintainability, etc.


####  Schedule: In particular, specify which functions you intend to design, prototype, and test in Round 1, and subsequently implement and test again in Round 2. Also specify which functions you intend to design, implement, and test in Round 3. Of course, the primary function of your site/app should be implemented first.
